# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

# In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

print(6 + 4)

# Python divides the operators in the following groups:

# Arithmetic operators
# Assignment operators
# Comparison operators
# Logical operators
# Identity operators
# Membership operators
# Bitwise operators
